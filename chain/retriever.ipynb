INTRODUCTION   \\nPower utility facilities across the world are \\ncurrently face d with the prominent challenges of reducing \\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions, limiting the peaks of \\nenergy cost, optimizing their grids, increasing the supply \\nof eco -friendly renewable source for meeting the energy \\ndemand a long with efficient power storage and advanced \\nmetering infrastructure to monitor efficiently the DR \\n(Demand Response) integrity [ 3][4][5]. Smart Grid \\nnetworks have started to replace the conventional electric \\nutilities in recent times, owing to it being an optimized \\nself-healing, intelligent monitoring, communication and \\ncontrol technology. Apart from being more eco -friendly \\nand sustainable, it could provide a higher resilience, \\nreliability and support for the ever -growing economy.   \\nAccurate forecasting o f the demand in power \\nload is one of the pivotal aspects, which  needs to be \\nconsidered while focusing on the framework of the Smart -\\nGrid network. Predicting the consumed load accurately \\nlimits the wastage of energy and saves astronomical \\nfigures of dollars  invested by the power utilities on a \\nglobal scale. To add to the plethora of benefits derived, it would even greatly reduce the greenhouse emissions \\nowing to the matching production and consumption ratio. \\nForecasters have come up with various algorithms a iming \\nat curbing the above mentioned challenges of which – \\nartificial neural networks, linear regression algorithm and \\nthe curve fitting, have proved out to be the most accurate. \\nIn this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed which uses \\nartificial neural ne tworks for training and testing the data \\nto be forecasted . Moreover , linear  regression technique for \\nadding on the temperature sensitivities of humidity, wind \\nspeed and location is also proposed. There could be a \\nscenario where some power utilities may not  have access \\nto meteorological facilities, which would render the \\nextrinsic variable factors of temperature fluctuations \\nuseless and eventually would get down the predicted \\nefficiency. Owing to this factor, historical data has been \\nused in this paper to co mmensurate with the seasonal \\nvariations. Our proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm has \\nbeen  proved practically to have benefit ed commercially \\nwith a forecasting efficiency of 99.2% – 99.45%.  \\nThe remaining portions of this paper have been \\norganized as the follows.

RELATED WORK \\nPredictions and forecasting has always intrigued \\nthe human mind. To determine accurately the amount of \\npower to be generated by a power utility company, thus \\nresulting in ecological, monetary and resource \\nconser vation, a major emphasis is laid upon forecasting \\nmechanisms.  \\nUnder this section, different methodologies have been \\npresented which are currently under use by power u tility \\nplants on a global scale . \\nA. Artific ial Neu ral Networks  \\nThe advanced functionalities of the artificial neural \\nnetwork  (ANN ) are possible due to the interconnected \\nneurons within the network which constantly evolve \\nbased upon the synaptic weights. They then back -\\ncalculate the weighted average by comparing the \\nthreshold value fed with this average and fire the \\ncorresponding output si gnal.  \\nOnce appropriate values have been fed to the input \\nlayer neurons, the evolution per layer begins wherein the \\noutput neurons are triggered because of which the ANN is \\nsynonymously even known as the feed -forward algorithm . \\nSynaptic weights and thresh olds together contribute \\ntowards the training phase of the neurons. Training a \\nneural network involves the optimization of the nonlinear \\nfunctions dealt within the model. Various methods for \\nsolving the nonlinear functions exist – Gauss -Newton \\nalgorithm, L evenberg -Marquardt algorithm and genetic \\nalgorithm which are all aimed towards finding the local \\noptima and finally getting the forecasted values.  \\nIn [6], authors investigated the ability of neural \\nnetwork to predict the hourly load using Particle Swarm \\nOptimization (PSO) algorithm to adjust weights and \\nbiases in order to minimize the error objective function of \\na neural network to obtain a short term load forecasting. \\nPSO shows its ability to minimize the error function with \\nhigh efficiency. In this study , it was found that selecting \\nproper values of network structure, input data, and PSO \\nparameters are major factors that affect the performance \\naccuracy of the network. It shows also that using weather \\ncondition data can positively influence the training an d \\ntesting results.  \\n In [7], authors  present ed an algorithm which combined  \\nboth time series and regression  approaches. Their \\nproposed  algorithm utilize s a layered perceptron ANN  \\nwhich uses weather information for modeling. The ANN \\nis able to perform non-linear modeling and adaptation. It \\ndoes not require assumption of any functional relationship \\nbetween lo ad and weather variables in ad vance.   \\nIn [8], authors used eleven different weather \\nparameters to make load forecasting more accurate. The \\nparamete rs used for comparing the performance of \\nlearning techniques are: mean absolute percentage error, \\nmillion floating -point operations performed per learning \\nand time taken per learning. The first parameter gives the \\naccuracy of recall: the second, the comple xity of the \\nlearning technique; the third, a measure of the speed of the \\nlearning technique.  \\nB. Linear Regression Technique  \\nIn the linear regression algorithm, the scenario is \\nexpressed in terms of a linear equation involving several \\nindependent variables and  a single dependent variable, \\nwhich would itself be contained within a set of \\nindependent attributes. If β is supposed to be the \\nregression parameters which is dependent on the variables \\nx, the load Y can be expressed in terms of the equation \\n(1): \\n      Y(t) = β 0x0(t) + β 1x1(t) + β 2x2(t) + … β nxn(t)       (1) \\nThe least square estimate technique is used within the \\nregression model, for minimizing the squared residual \\nsum [ 9]. The accuracy of a forecasted reading upon \\npassing Phase II, i.e. regression algorit hm relies within the \\nextent of the regression function fitting the dataset [ 10]. \\nChecks are thus imposed into this model by using the \\nCurve fitting algorithm, to make sure that the fitting curve \\ndoes not exceed to the limit of hampering the whole \\nsystem  [11].  \\nTo summarize the inspiration of this model, the \\nindividual methodologies of ANN, Linear Regression \\nwere used and curve -fitting, comprising of factors – dew \\npoint, humidity, temperature, seasonal variations, was \\nutilized. Previous works in this area of  load forecasting  \\nhave only focused on improvising either of the \\naforementioned methods. Uniquely, our proposed hybrid \\nforecasting algorithm, brings in the propagation training -\\nset ideas of the ANN, along with the variables used to \\nfilter out irregularitie s by using the regression algorithm \\nand curve -fitting to perform multiple iterations mapping \\nthe predicted curve based on historical data.  \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

ARCHITECTURE OF THE H YBRID ALGORITHM  \\nThe proposed algorithm beg ins with the insignificant \\nattributes being discarded from the data set, followed by \\nthe data undergoing the first phase of training and testing \\nthrough the neural networks before being forwarded to the \\nsecond phase of linear r egression implementation. Our \\nproposed algorithm  has been described in  Fig. 1 . \\nFigure 1. Algorithm explaining the hybrid proposed algorithm  \\nThe initial training set is matched for 70% and 30% of \\nthe data being reserved for testing the model, followed by \\na 50:50 proportion after an ide al number of epochs. The \\nNeural Networks have been implemented using the \\nLevenberg -Marquardt  (LM)  algorithm.  \\nLM algorithm is an iterative approach for solving the \\nleast square equations, involving the forecasting \\nproblems. Let us assume J to be the Jacobi an matrix of the \\nsystem under consideration, λ being the damping factor \\nfor the Levenberg system, Ϭ being the weight update \\nvector and E being the error vector at the output nodes of \\nthe framework deployed. The weight update vector \\nreminds the forecaster o f the adjustments he needs to \\nmake while the training process for the nodes involved \\nalong with the damping factor. The LM algorithm, can be \\nfurther described to process and solve the equation (2):  \\n \\n(Jt J + λI) Ϭ = JtE           (2)  \\nEach epoch involved during the phase 1 would involve \\ncomputing the Jacobian followed by the error gradient, \\nfollowed by updating the weights using the Ϭ. Further, a \\nsquared error sum is calculated followed by decreasing \\nthe value of the damping factor once  convergence has \\nbeen reached.  \\nBased on constant simulations, the optimal value for \\nthe ANN training and testing sets have been register ed to \\nbe kept as shown in Table.1 . \\n Table 1 .

       "'Based on the provided context, the answer to the question \"What are neural networks?\" is:\\n\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes or neurons that process information and learn from experience through a series of interactions. ANNs can be trained to perform various tasks, such as pattern recognition, classification, and prediction. In the context of power systems, ANNs have been used for load forecasting, peak load forecasting, and short-term load forecasting. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Gauss-Newton algorithm, and genetic algorithms are some of the methods used to train ANNs.\\n\\nIn addition to the traditional feedforward neural network algorithm, other techniques such as linear regression algorithm and curve fitting have also been found to be accurate in power system forecasting. However, these techniques do not provide the same level of flexibility and adaptability as ANNs.\\n\\nThe proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm in the paper combines the strengths of both ANNs and linear regression techniques to achieve better forecasting efficiency. By using historical data to compensate for seasonal variations, the algorithm is able to provide accurate predictions even without access to meteorological facilities. The authors have demonstrated practically that their proposed hybrid algorithm has a forecasting efficiency of 99.2% - 99.45%.'"
